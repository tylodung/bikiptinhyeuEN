custom_excerpt: Love should come from two sides, only from two sides, love is really love.

---

Love needs to be cultivated on both sides, if only one person is self-motivated, then the relationship will end, but until then maybe both are tired to go crazy .

Sure, everyone dreams of building a happy dream with the man he loves.

However, there are times when the marriage seems to be no more of two people. In life, inherently love someone who denigrates and speaks out. This person is not age, the other family is not stable, this guy is not very handsome or the guy looks a bit ... gentle.

So ever since the marriage of one individual has become a terrible concern of many others. From parents to relatives, neighbors. Not only from acquaintances, but also people who know a little bit ... also give suggestions on the choice.

Choose your self-love!

That is the opinion of Hamlet Zhang in the book is different: "But sometimes, I should also imagine the scene that I will wake up next to a person that I have nothing to passion.

I do not like the smell of hair, do not remember what from their bodies. I forget to take care of myself, because there is not one person enough to want to be beautiful, want to better every day for them.

Because I know love-love-I will be like, so thought Hamlet will love-love-me because: when they love me, I have pain, but in the pain is also present a happiness Too many times than when you choose someone you do not have feelings when living together!

Choosing the one you love will be pain, but it will be the most painful pain worth living in this life.

Our grandfathers, even our parents, sometimes come together, sometimes not because of love, but because of the arrangement of parenthood.

Parents still say: "Living together long-term, even without love, but also means, stick to a child very much! Sometimes to live together, not necessarily love, love also has such power! "

Not love each other, live together will have love, but is "love". This "love" is derived from marriage, responsibility, children, it as a firm bond between the two.

"Love" makes you safe, but it's faint.
