Lack of respect and altruism
The foundation of love is respect and altruism. But a lot of you, because of the wrong one twice of the enemy that becomes disrespectful to that person. Many ladies love to "climb up the neck" lover because they want to. That makes the guy "warm memories" although sometimes they still follow and do not complain. In contrast, some guys are patriarchal, like to bully the lover in front of friends without knowing it is disrespectful and hurt others.

Whether a son or daughter, the endurance of each person is limited. No one can stand the fault of the other person "chew chewing" and then stigmatize. Or do not insist on your own will not respect, listening to the opinions of the enemy is easy to make love fatigue and fade.

Lack of respect will make each other attractive. From love, can lead to resentment. Do not even look at each other very often. Everybody has mistakes. So, if mistakes are not too big then it is better to say it straight, and forgive each other better than to keep in mind and remember it.

Struggle
When you start to get used to and love each other, the argument is often inevitable. Even when we get to know each other, sometimes we need to have anger, ups and downs to make love enough sweet and bitter. But whatever the level of it, especially the anger to argue when love. Many girls often have the habit of "anger", anger is angry, anger is quarreling and quarrel is a farewell. They do not know that they accidentally killed their love.

Not only that, girls often demanded to break up, to "threaten" it every time argue. It becomes effective with a lot of guys, but too much momentum will cause emotional break up. That is why, when girls are angry, they will both be normal soon. As for boys, when they have no idea of ​​breaking up, when they really want to stop, hard things can make them change their minds. By that time the boys were really depressed and tired.

Imagine "fighting to love each other more", many young couples accidentally erased his feelings when it was beautiful. Understanding each other has many ways, not just quarrelation can know what the other think. Therefore, avoid being angry, jealous or sad for unnecessary reasons.

Selfish and persistent
The selfishness of thinking for yourself and the obstinacy are one of the reasons that people love more ... "bored." Selfish and persistent often appear with the guy or her patrician. Always insists that you are right and people always have fault with me. It is hard for a girl or a son to endure the persistence of others for life.

Love but always put your rights up front is selfish when love. I myself do not want the other person to think of themselves, then I should not just think about my own interests and ask others to be like this to me. If only throughout the day, comparative damage, love is never durable.

Try not to put yourself thought: "Why do not people think for themselves?" Only when people realize that they are always thinking to them, they can then open their hearts.

Lack of interest leads to the appearance of a third person ...
Some couples know each other for a long time, the more they are concerned about each other. Part because they trust each other, partly because they are used too long, it is difficult to be like the original time. That does not mean they do not love each other. They simply are not too constrained, to challenge whether they can go together the rest. At that time, the third person can intervene, causing love to shake.

Of course, do not confuse care with coercion or the kind of parenting care you should avoid. The concern is to find out what other people think and want and become the strongest support when they need it. Being together when necessary, even if it is only a few minutes, will be more meaningful than spending time together.

In the absence of interest from the enemy, it is easy to find new people. But newcomers are just one of the few causes for love to fade. The main reason is that people suddenly feel no longer love and want to find a new horizon.
