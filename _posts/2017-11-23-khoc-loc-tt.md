custom_excerpt: Love is also a "addiction" and it is possible to treat it with medication such as treating a common illness in the human body.

Brian Earp, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, believes that love is an addiction, and that it can be treated with medicine as a cure for a common illness in the human body.

Brian Earp and colleagues at the research institute observed love and its activity in the human brain.

The main purpose of this study is to track how love begins, how it develops, or how it gradually and diminishes.

Oxford University researchers began to study the effects of ecstasy, the chemical name for MDMA. This is a common but illegal substance, in the form of a drug that increases the excitability of the nervous system.

"MDMA shows that some couples - in terms of clinical studies with the help of therapists - have changed their minds and approached the relationship in a healthier way.

Or they may discover that the relationship is no longer relevant to us, "Wired magazine quoted Earp as saying.

Earp also points out that some drugs called SSRIs can make you lose interest in others, reducing your attachment to a relationship you no longer enjoy.

The six-year experience of taking medication is a passionate affair

According to James, the feeling that he is like "when you see life is bad, there is a loved one to hug you. That is a deep consolation. " "Right now, you just know that everything is fine," James said.

Meanwhile, according to Colleen, another character using MDMA was interviewed by Wired magazine, using more stimulant drugs, he and his partner easily linked emotionally instead of looking for counseling. outsider.

Is it really a love affair?

The dark side of the use of love drugs occurs when couples mistakenly use drugs to "warm up" their loved ones with drugs to "build a relationship." .

In fact, this love feeling is wonderful but completely untrue. "When I do not have medicine, I do not find myself in love with her. The fact is that MDMA has created this fictional love affair for me, "James said.

While for SSRIs, Mr Earp said the drug could also cause a number of side effects.

Accordingly, SSRIs may reduce the ability of the user to empathize with others, reducing sexual desire. This drug can also be abused by another person to "split" a couple in love, like gay couples.
