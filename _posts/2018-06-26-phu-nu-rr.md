76% of women prefer a bearded man, 53% of women prefer bearded men to more than shaved men, according to Dailystar, quoting a survey from the Gleeden affair dating site.

To get this result, Gleeden asked 6,000 women about whether they wanted to have sex with a masculine man.

The survey also revealed that 61% of women have admitted cheating on their husbands or lovers to have sex with a bearded man.

To ask why men have more beards? As a result, 41% of women said that men with bearded hair looked sexier and more masculine.

While 29% of other women find this attractive to men, 17% feel more bearded men feel safer.

About 6,000 women in the survey were married and those in love.

In the journal Evolutionary Biology, previously published a survey of 8520 women, this survey sought to find out what women actually thought about men with multiple antennae.

Scientists have found that men with little antennae are highly valued in short-term adultery.

Those who have a thick beard look like the old man are often noticed by women and want to have a longer relationship.

Talking about evolution, the beard acts as a sign of fertility and the ability to survive in life. Bearded people are usually better.
