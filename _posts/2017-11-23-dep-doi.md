Investigators conducted a study of over 3,000 people in the United States, according to height, weight, age and appearance criteria. Lead researcher Dr Satoshi Kanazawa from the London School of Economics said that her body's attractiveness was hereditary, and that girls often inherited more of their parents than their sons. This result is part of the "evolutionary strategy" chosen by men or women to exist and is also consistent with the state of the study of gender evolution.

Previously, there was also a study on this subject. The study was conducted with 2,000 Americans and showed that women are becoming more attractive because beautiful women have more children than average people, and the majority of these children are women. .

Satoshi Kanazawa's research shows that the reason attractive men may be decreasing is that the gene pool of this beauty is more costly to give to boys than to girls.

In fact, the conclusion of Satoshi Kanazawa received quite mixed opinions and many people said that not convinced by:

- The attractiveness of the objects is evaluated when they are 7 years old and the cute kids are not sure to grow up pretty.

- Beauty norms change over time and vary greatly from one culture to another.
