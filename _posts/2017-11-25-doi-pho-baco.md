Many people insist that they would rather break up their marriage than suffer the "mother-in-law."

Perhaps, her husband's sister is one of the germs that cause discord between the couple. My husband is not blood, nor is it my choice, so the relationship with her husband is the right to be forced to "live together" and endure. Therefore, in order to "dominate" the "Ngo side Ngo", the best way is not the loser but the "conquer".

Conquer before the wedding

No one is "more dangerous" than your husband, but no one helps you score better with her husband than her husband. So before the wedding, take advantage of your husband's feelings. Meeting, meeting, chatting as two girlfriends, cooking together, shopping ... will make the relationship between husband and sister in the future more intimate.

Thanks husband for bridging

Ask your husband to do diplomacy so that the two sides get the information sympathetic about each other. At the same time, he has to do "internal affairs" to inform his lover how her sister or sister has hobbies, then the new bride knows how "dimensional". From dress to speech, the bride should not be too different from her husband.

Always compliment her husband

When the bride to her husband's house should only praise that should not criticize anything especially home, the life of her husband. Particularly her husband, too, should be praised not recommended. In particular, absolutely do not say in front of her husband the same sentence as complimenting her family, her husband's husband family. Not bad husband in front of her husband.

Actively make matchmaker for her husband

If your husband has a lover, he must welcome enthusiastically, actively cultivate, praise the good points of his husband's love. If you do not have a boyfriend actively positive matchmaking to cultivate happiness for her husband. But the most important is to give her husband real feelings, as her sister to love, motivate, instruct.

According to psychologists, a family is often based on two things: blood relations and choice. However, the relationship between the bride and the sibling lies outside both. No intestinal blood, not selected but still have to live in a roof. Therefore, their incompatibility with their personality, hobbies, and viewpoints is understandable. New brides should understand this issue that builds relationships based on altruism and sympathy.
