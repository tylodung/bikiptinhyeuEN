There is no reason why she is not interested in conquering her husband's stomach. Have you let him "want to wear what to wear", shirt wrinkles, all the voices are dozens that do not need to go to work still need to find the dive. Then she let her husband's ears hungry to hear the sweet words, though knowing that the men's ears seemed to be born just to receive the light, not dazzling sound.

The things that any man would like to hear listed below are not really too hard to say. They are also not fake smilies, which makes the speaker feel self-conscious, not sincere. Conversely, if love and respect are still filled, these sweet but very simple words come from our hearts. The problem is that we accidentally put them somewhere. Then why do not we take them, blow them warm love to give him?

So, what kind of husbands do we really listen to?

The first is the praise. Listening is simple but actually this is what many sisters forget most. Why with pure social relations we can be very skillful, courteous, sweet, but with the people in the house we see the praise for his man is "drawing the", is "do not need "...? Actually, praise is timely, especially after the man has done something for his family, for his wife, for his children; After all the sexes, or after anything that the woman knows he is for himself and only for himself ... like a miracle to make a man feel good and feel Useful for your loved ones. Excited excitement will transform into motivation so that man always regret his effort and time to be praised!

No man wants him, his energy, his contributions to the beloved are underestimated. Men want to be appreciated for their hard work and want to record everything that belongs to them, even if no man says it. One of the sexual characteristics of men is that they rarely show what they really want from their partner, but they want to be recognized and praised. It is this, if there is love plus a little sensitive and sensible, than anyone else, the wife will do the best this. Do not "pour cold water" into the man's efforts for you. You will definitely get back from him more interesting and sweet than you expected!

And here is a typical example: If it is clear that your husband has made a great effort to cook a dish, then no matter how awkward he is, the dish is not exactly what you mean. Well, do not be blunt to make him lose interest. Give praise and appreciation for his work and affection he put into the dish, not to make himself a hard judge to look at the unacceptable of the food he cooked. You see, just a little bit different in your mind that you can make him want to be with you!

The fact that many women are impeccably placed anywhere on the bed except. Up to this point of the 21st century, there are still some things that show the sweetness of the man in bed ... indecent. So you are silent not satisfied nor blamed. The "fun" should have come from both ends only on the side of every man. Why not change a bit so that both are happy and satisfied. Which is hard when praising your man is great, that I like the smell of his sweat, like the way he loves me ...?

Let your man's eyes always be filled with affection and pride, tell him at any time that he is "proud of you", "thank you for the heaven and earth you gave me each other ... "and the like. About this many women consider the "cheo ward". The sister said to say so embarrassed though it is true that in mind also think so.

Strangely, when we love each other, the sweet words flow like streams. And yet it was the same man, when he was already his husband, they found it unnecessary for his men to enjoy the sweet whisper of sweetness. Actually, the problem is not about being busy with children. The problem is not in age now also no shoots. The main problem lies in the thought that they are married and then do not need to conquer each other, flirting. Invisible, the abandonment of the ears of the man missing the sweetness has made the relationship becomes more and more distant from the time they themselves do not know.

Something for our sisters to exchange. The purpose of keeping her husband in sweet mellow is already clear. Only wish the sisters realize their need and bring them into married life!
