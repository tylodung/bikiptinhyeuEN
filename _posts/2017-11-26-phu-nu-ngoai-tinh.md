custom_excerpt: It is often said in love, men and women are two differences in adultery.

If a man can go to bed with both women they do not have affection. Women only sleep with the person they love. The adulterer will return to his wife and children.

But perhaps for women who do not want to go home when they have an affair, they are willing to throw away all their houses, their husbands, to follow the call of the heart.

When in love, women are crazy and crazy. They can be wholeheartedly even sacrificed for the man they love. So many women accept a single mother because the man loves to have a wife or a man cheated.

A woman should always get the love of the man, especially the man next to them. Because that person they have exchanged youth, dedicating their wholeheartedly but unrepentant, so their affair is just the same way.

But one thing is certain, adultery is often because of love, because of affection. If they do not really have feelings, they will not come to other men for physiological needs like men.

What is the purpose of a woman's affair?

The goal of women in adultery sometimes does not come from sex. They tend to be emotional, emotional rather than fleshly. Therefore, adultery also means that they no longer belong to the family.

Meanwhile, the male aim of adultery is just sex. When women are "in bed" with them a few times, they can "give up" without any regrets. When the "flesh" is satisfied, the other woman does not have much meaning to him anymore.

Adultery women are despised, despised often times men. Why, because in the eyes of others, women have to be loyal, whole heartedly for husband and child.

But manly adultery, women can not. Because they do not have love, they get adultery.

In summary, when adultery, women are always suffering and suffering. By adultery, sometimes women give their hearts to men who are not her husband.

Often, "giving" is always a mistake. On the contrary, men will find for themselves the sweet and bitter aftertaste from relationships beyond the burdens and guilt.

Because what they point at to a woman is never a sincere affection.
