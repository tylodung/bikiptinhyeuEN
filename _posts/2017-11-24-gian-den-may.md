Men's self-esteem is like a diamond that the wise wife must cherish every where, every time. Therefore, happiness at hand, do not fool that engulfed "in a note" just because of these insulting words, the girl.

"He looked at her husband and saw" ...

Many women think that taking another man as a "mirror" will have a positive impact on their husbands, a way to "motivate" their husbands. But it is a wrong behavior.

"Every time I exercise I'm lazy. He looked at his brother Cuong Nga see, than he a few years that the solid man, and he ... '. Just one sentence, he just got mad at me. I just want you to be motivated to practice, healthier than without expecting him to love, "Tuyet Van, 30, lives in Ho Chi Minh City.

According to psychologists, comparing husbands and wives with other men, financially or physically makes husbands feel despair and easily lose their temper. "Your husband's age is your brother's house, car title. And he, look at ... I have not finished the sentence, he raised his voice: 'If so then you go to your husband's house but stay ...' and then leave "- My Thanh - an English teacher - told.

"I do not marry you ..."

In times of trouble, or when the couple is in a small affair, many angry women blurted out: "If you do not marry like you do not suffer this."

Even some people want to assert their self worth, see her husband get his "win number" that ultimately do not know how to maintain. Some people have the momentum of old love has now achieved, how rich to imply contact, comparison. Praise the "old man" is the "subdue" your current husband. Ladies, do not play knives like that, cut that day.

Although these words just accidentally uttered in anger, you also made him realize that he has no meaning in your life. As a result, psychiatrists recommend that when you are hot, the best way for women to rest is to refrain or stay away, but never say words that can make you regret for the rest of your life.

"What is it worth you to do?"

While your husband confesses what he thinks is important or interesting, you respond with extreme indifference. Your husband may think you are not interested in what he or she is interested in, or more dangerous than your husband may think you are despising his perception, his rating should be "not acceptable".

This is what causes the wounded to feel hurt because of the feeling of "devaluation" in the eyes of his wife, his wife despised.

So, psychologists advised women should know how to express "the same tone" with her husband, listening attentively to the sharing and disclosure of her husband. You can also ask him one or two sentences to increase his excitement. He will have a sense of esteem and thus, the couple is well connected.

It is said that men and women are in the liberal nature, not "notice", "pick up" the trivia. But you should remember that the "me" of men is so big, what makes you most hated is to be disregarded, but who show that attitude is his wife, he would be considered "unbearable." So, want to keep your home, never make such mistakes, the girls.
